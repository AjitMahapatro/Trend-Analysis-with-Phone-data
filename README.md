# Trend Analysis with Phone data
This project, implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks, focuses on the analysis of user behavior data from a dataset named `user.csv`. It leverages key libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

The notebook covers essential data analysis steps including:
**1. Data Loading and Understanding**: Importing the dataset and exploring its structure, statistical summaries, column types, and initial rows.
**2. Data Integrity Checks:**** Identifying and handling missing values, empty strings, and duplicate entries to ensure data quality.
**3. Data Selection and Transformation:**** Performing operations such as filtering rows based on conditions (e.g., users with high app installs or low app usage time), sorting data, and identifying unique values within columns.

This project provides insights into user device models, operating systems, app usage, screen time, battery drain, number of installed apps, data usage, age, gender, and user behavior classification, making it suitable for exploring patterns and characteristics within user data.
